		<itunes:summary>Welcome to the weekend - well, the middle of it - in the UK anyway!

I have made a surprise episode! I have been doing them monthly in the past year so this one is a leetle early, I just found some absolute belters I thought I would have a productive weekend and grace your ears with all the delights I have found. 
Straight in with the tough stuff- quite techy this time around - MaRLo can stay, what a whopper with Darkside. Not much in to what he has been churning out recently until this BEAST! LOVE LOVE LOVE... Some epic uplifters in here and some classics too - ending with a small tradition I seem to have built in to the past few eps, something from the man Scot Project - his remix of Universal Music! 
Enjoy guys...

<p>
</p><div>This mix again follows suit with recent tradition in that we start off with some progressive loveliness at around 130bpm and winde up to some old skool classics - including the legend that was; Tillman Urchmacher - On The Run, which is one of my all time favourite tunes; for some reason I have not played yet. We end this episode on some classic Hard Trance from the early naughties! I hope you enjoy… <img src="http://www.podbean.com/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></div>

The original blurb with it.....


Of course Trance goes back to the Acid House era in its earliest forms, being heard from about the mid eighties. But the sound really came to fruition in my opinion when Paul Van Dyk released his remix of Humate - Love Stimulation in 1993, definitely the pioneer of the current sound, bringing the european sound completely to the forefront of the trance scene. I have recorded a mix in complete chronological order, with one track selected from each year since 1993 up to the present day. All my own personal preferences and aren't necessarily actual number one tracks from each year, although most of course are recognised and were hits in the scene in various forms over the years. And the cover of course drawing a little inspiration from Stephen Hawkings book, a Brief History of Time.....

		<itunes:summary>Well hello....

A journey including plenty of freshened reworks of some older tracks. Travelling all the way from 130bpm to 141bpm. Sounds on the progressive side all the way through to uplifting bangers, a spattering of Psy and finishing on a smidgen of Tech Trance. :)

<p>With a true passion for music alongside a well-developed taste in all genres, an energising stage presence and the ability to read perfectly his audience, its common knowledge that TOM COSTELLOE has got the art of DJ’ing to a standard that’s hard to beat…</p>
<p>He started DJ’ing in 1987, playing out at local pubs and clubs, and doing Weddings, Birthdays ETC. His natural talent was soon spotted and in 1991 he was offered a weekly residency at FUTURES a House club in Deptford (London).

<p>In the Summer of 1995 Tom was asked to become resident for 
LOVE RANCH at SPACE (Ibiza) 
on Thursday Mornings. Tom impressed several promoters on the island and was approached to play the legendary SPACE on Sunday mornings supporting the likes of Brandon Block and Alex P, and proved his versatility with set’s both inside and on the terrace. Whilst in Ibiza Tom Also played for SIGN OF THE TIMES, at many of the SUNRISE parties and at CAFÉ MAMBO and was also headlining at many of the smaller San Antonio clubs.</p>
<p>Back in the UK Tom Continued to Play for SIGN OF THE TIMES as the main resident, this time based in London at THE ROCKET. And 1998 saw further visits to Ibiza where Tom played for SUNNY SIDE UP at ES PARIDIS, CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and the now infamous GODSKITCHEN at AMNESIA where he made 6 appearances as a resident which continued the following year.</p>
<p>In 2000 Tom relocated to Devon as resident and promoter of EYECON at the 
DANCE ACADEMY, PLYMOUTH - playing alongside some of the world’s most talented and most wanted DJ’S, booking the artist’s for this event and putting his unique slant on the line up’s - you could never say it was all about one style, more like a mish mash of several! And that’s the way TOM liked it!</p>
<p>This popular Saturday night event boasted a weekly attendance of 1200+ and an ever-growing group of dedicated followers that crammed the cavernous club almost full to capacity every week, all waiting for the time when TOM hit the decks with his weekly assault of upfront and classic tunes – basically</p>
<p>YOU knew when TOM COSTELLOE was on!!!</p>
<p>EYECON @ the Dance Academy was voted club of the year (regional) in MIXMAG in 2004 and received several similar accolades in music publications such as DJ mag, Muzik and Ministry Magazines.</p>
<p>Tom, accompanied by

<p>1) Chris Malinchak - So Good To Me (Original Mix)
2) Sia - Breathe (Arty Bootleg)
3) Gabriel &amp; Dresden Feat. Molly - Let Go (Blake Jarrell Remix)

		<itunes:summary>Apologies for the extended break fellow Trance heads.... I have started back at university and it just so happens to be my 3rd and final year, so things have gotten a little serious my end! Fear not I will be posting mixes as and when possible, atleast twice a month from now :)
Back this time with a fresh collection of tunes journeying from 130bpm to 140bpm, Progressive/Tough and Uplifting trance, including a collaboration from Digital Self and Tektonic and myself! It goes by the name of 'Drift' and is a techy driven uplifting monster :) Hope you like!

<p>Luke and Joel Heaton bio…..</p>
<p>In 2001 at the tender age of 14 these two boys were introduced to the hard dance scene thanks to listening to Mark EG and M Zone tapes passed down from older friends and siblings, this was the start of their musical ambition which has progressed massively over the years.</p>

<p>The main musical focal points in the Luke and Joels sets are Trance and Hardtrance; however their abilitys to be able play almost anything has also seen them rock dance floors with House, Hardstyle and European Hardcore, this is something they feel is necessary these days as it opens more doors and allows them to play more freely.</p>
<p>In 2010 dreams became reality when the boys were asked by Nick the Kid to play in Ibiza for Hindsight, this saw them playing in some major clubs, one of them being the mighty Eden, where they played for Judgement Sundays alongside a star studded line up of DJs they could only dream of. As well as playing for other huge nights such as Tidy in Ibiza, they have also rocked pool parties and various other clubs and bars on the White Isle and gained themselves a fan base of people. They have since been back twice to play in Ibiza, this includes Hindsight’s massive September 2011 trip – An Island of Trance.
Luke and Joel are thrilled to have been asked to return to Ibiza in 2012, In June and September which will see them play at some of the worlds biggest clubs and alongside some of the worlds biggest DJs yet again.</p>
<p>The duo’s ambitions don’t stop at mixing, however, they have also been working extremely hard on the production side of music. In 2011 they visited the Organ Donors studio and produced a track with them which has been released on Implosion Digital, they have also spent time with other local producers, having a more hands on approach and learning different styles which they hope will open up new ideas and visions to the pair until they are satisfied with creating that sound and feel they both love.</p>
<p>With Future sounds hosting a range of nights, and them both starting to become regular faces for Hindsight, not forgetting to mention the pairs return to Ibiza in June and September as well as many more other events to be playing for this year, the pair have come a long way from that first set in an empty room. They continue to work hard at what they love and push themselves in their mixing and producing, 2012 is set to be yet another amazing year for the Heatons!</p>

Luke and Joel Heaton bio.....

In 2001 at the tender age of 14 these two boys were introduced to the hard dance scene thanks to listening to Mark EG and M Zone tapes passed down from older friends and siblings, this was the start of their musical ambition which has progressed massively over the years.

Although both underage Luke and Joel started to attend dance events such as Slinky when they were just 16, this then progressed to bigger nights out and to a wider selection of different dance music genres up and down the country, as their love and passion for the music grew so did their interest in mixing.

The main musical focal points in the Luke and Joels sets are Trance and Hardtrance; however their abilitys to be able play almost anything has also seen them rock dance floors with House, Hardstyle and European Hardcore, this is something they feel is necessary these days as it opens more doors and allows them to play more freely.

In 2010 dreams became reality when the boys were asked by Nick the Kid to play in Ibiza for Hindsight, this saw them playing in some major clubs, one of them being the mighty Eden, where they played for Judgement Sundays alongside a star studded line up of DJs they could only dream of. As well as playing for other huge nights such as Tidy in Ibiza, they have also rocked pool parties and various other clubs and bars on the White Isle and gained themselves a fan base of people. They have since been back twice to play in Ibiza, this includes Hindsight’s massive September 2011 trip – An Island of Trance.
Luke and Joel are thrilled to have been asked to return to Ibiza in 2012, In June and September which will see them play at some of the worlds biggest clubs and alongside some of the worlds biggest DJs yet again.

The duo's ambitions don't stop at mixing, however, they have also been working extremely hard on the production side of music. In 2011 they visited the Organ Donors studio and produced a track with them which has been released on Implosion Digital, they have also spent time with other local producers, having a more hands on approach and learning different styles which they hope will open up new ideas and visions to the pair until they are satisfied with creating that sound and feel they both love.

With Future sounds hosting a range of nights, and them both starting to become regular faces for Hindsight, not forgetting to mention the pairs return to Ibiza in June and September as well as many more other events to be playing for this year, the pair have come a long way from that first set in an empty room. They continue to work hard at what they love and push themselves in their mixing and producing, 2012 is set to be yet another amazing year for the Heatons!

<p>DJ-KRASH success in and playing quality tunes that both excite existing fans. “I think trance is becoming a broader term for a lot of different genres; it’s no longer a specific kind of music within the dance scene,” says Dj-krash. “Trance has elements of all different types of music. I play a lot of tracks that are labelled as progressive, tribal progressive, techno, trance, euphoric trance, vocal trance, melodic progressive and all types of hard dance. These days it’s really hard to label a specific sound. Styles are mutating and evolving into this all-over new sound, which is basically dance music going back to its roots. There’s so much good music out there and I don’t want to limit myself to just one style.”</p>

		<itunes:summary>February's guest mix, this month local legend Aaron Cook takes to the decks for us, with a Touch Prog  Electro House mix.

In his short but sharp rise in his Djing career Aaron is going from strength to strength! Building a good reputation for his tight flawless mixing and excellent knowlege and selection of tunes, he definately knows how to read what the crowd wants.

After winning the Crash Manor Dj Competition in February last year year he then went on to become a weekly resident there playing progressive and tech trance for the night Crash @ Crash Manor which hosted many big name DJs including Guiseppe Ottaviani, Simon Patterson, Sean Tyas, Richard Durand and many more!.

Unfortunately the night shut down due to change in music policy but since then he has begun to play regular all over the south west. Aaron has also had recent regular gigs playing in the 103 bar and the Baby Box rooms of the world famous Ministry of Sound and two recent gigs at the 02 Academy Brixton, both based in London While playing there he has played on the same lineups as big names like Worlds Number 1 Armin Van Buuren, Eddie Halliwell, Jochen Miller, Seb Fontaine, Fabio, Jordan Suckley. Markus Schulz, Andy Moor, Above and Beyond, Mauro Picotto, Mat Zo, Daniel Portman, Jaytech, Stefano Noferini and many more!

2011 has been a great year so far, wilth Aaron playing again at Ministry of Sound and the 02 Academy Brixton for Armin Van Buurens tour, he also has played twice in Ibiza this year, playing for popular scottish brand Rectify and also Vicky Devines night Ultraviolet.

Music is his PASSION! Enjoy.... Its awesome ;) xXx

		<itunes:summary>This is the Christmas Day Mix! Trance from beginning to end! Some beautiful and uplifting sounds to end your Christmas Day. A Franetic style journey from slower to faster. Digital Self Vs Tektonic featuring a couple of times in this mix with a track of their own and an awesome remix of Nick The Kid's Enigma, as well as a couple of classics chucked in for good measure  and an absolute storming track to finish.... Venom Presents Kasuma - Witness.... Released 7 years ago, and never used on my podcasts, I thought it was defo worth a play! :)

Merry Christmas everyone! :D

		<itunes:summary>Seem to have a slight theme running here with all the classics, but they are always worth a re run, especially these. All my previous Hard Dance podcasts have mainly focused on the European sound, this one is sticking strictly to the UK hard Trance sound with its roots based mainly in Hard House. 
Bit of a focus on the Riot Brothers in this mix, in my opinion they produced some of the best tracks of this Genre so thought I would overdose on them slightly for this podcast!!

Enjoy ;) xXx

But the sound really came to fruition in my opinion when Paul Van Dyk released his remix of Humate - Love Stimulation in 1993, definitely the pioneer of the current sound, bringing the european sound completely to the forefront of the trance scene.
I have recorded a mix in complete chronological order, with one track selected from each year since 1993 up to the present day. All my own personal preferences and aren’t necessarily actual number one tracks from each year, although most of course are recognised and were hits in the scene in various forms over the years.
And the cover of course drawing a little inspiration from Stephen Hawkings  book, a Brief History of Time…..</p>

I used to go to the Saturday night event which was known as Eyecon, Playing Trance  Hard Dance, seeing some of the best names in the Dance music scene, from Scott Project, to UberDruck, to Dave Pearce and everything inbetween.It shut down in 2006 after a raid, the building is still there, although sadly remains derilict.Tracklisting:1) Nalin  Kane Vs Denis The Menace - Cruising (Steve Murano Mix)2) Dark Monks - Insane (Steve Murano Vocal Remix)3) Heavens Cry - Till Tears Do us part (Flash Harry Remix)4) Miss Behavin' - Such A Good Feelin' (Lee Haslam Vs Guyver Remix)5) Riot Bros - Ripped out (Original Mix)6) Meteor 7 - Universal Music (Scott Project Remix)7) Atlantic Wave - Reforced (Giada Remix)8) Technoboy - Chapter 2 (Original Mix)9) DJ Isaac - The Edge (Original Mix)10) High Voltage - Bombs away (Original Mix)xXx</itunes:summary>

the podcast in my opinion goes brilliantly with the name in terms of choonage, a monster line up of tracks for your audio pleasure!!…… starts off uplifting, all the way through to techy trance with some filthy harder stuff at the end, all in all; a well and truly fractured trance mix!
